3. The pages are there and the username is going into the console and re-directing to the User page.
Files are set up in a "module" status as the prove01-routes is transferring the data needed to the prove01.js which acts like a controller.
The username is showing up in the console after it is entered.

4. I have not been able to get the username to show on the page.

5. The "coolest thing I learned while completing this assignment was how it is so similar to PHP module set up.
It gives me hope that I will do alright in this class since I loved and understood PHP.

6. Clearer instructions are always welcome. The video learning was a huge help.

7. I felt that I accomplished 4-"meets requirements". I felt I understood how things worked. I just ran out of time to figure the last part out.
I just got my second COVID shot and an too wiped out accomplish that right now.

8. All three paths that were in the assignment are there and they are all working properly. The username displays in the console.
