3. My application is accepting a book title and description and then displaying it on the page. 
These books will continue to be added to the list, however, I do not have it linked up to JSON file.
I used EJS and Express to write the program and display the data.
4. As far as I can tell from the assignment, all aspects are working correctly.
5. As per usual, I overthought everything so I think the coolest aspect of this assignment was that I got it to work the way I wanted it to.
6. The one thing I would change on this assignment would be the instructions on what port to have it diplayed on. I used the same one as last time
but I noticed in the Heroku video that he has it in the navigation bar. Are we supposed to do it that way? It would make more sense to me if it was.
7. I feel like I am between a 4 and a 5. I feel like it is working properly, but I'm not sure if it would be consideret above the requirements.
8. I took the time to style the page after it was working properly. I added a title so a user would know what the page was about and added titles to the
output so the user would know what they are looking at when the data displays.
